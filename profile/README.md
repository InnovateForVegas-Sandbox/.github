# The Innovate for Vegas Sandbox Org

This is a sandbox organization for newcomers to the [Innovate for Vegas Foundation](https://github.com/InnovateForVegas) github organization to become acquainted with Git and GitHub, to try out ideas, or to generally hack with reckless abandon, and then sometimes to practice fixing things to leave them functioning for the next time.

The same policies apply to this sibling organization as to our main org, and our Foundation policies and ethos govern overall.

## Joining and Onboarding and Contributing

We have default Community Health documents in the usual place which apply across our presence here on GitHub and beyond. This sandbox org will adhere to the main organization policies and so please find them in their origin locations and refer to them as needed:

[Code of Conduct - Innovate for Vegas Foundation](https://github.com/InnovateForVegas/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

[Contributing to this Project - Innovate for Vegas Foundation](https://github.com/InnovateForVegas/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

These documents will be mirrored in the sandbox as defaults, but the authoritative references are as linked above.

Please visit our own Howtos repository documenting how to get started with our organization and some basics about projects, tools, and a growing list of details and helpful hints:

[Foundation Howtos](https://github.com/InnovateForVegas/doc-org-howtos)

Note again, the Howtos are for all Innovate for Vegas Foundation projects, especially here in our GitHub org and repositories, practice naming and breaking repos and projects in the Sandbox!

### Join our Mailing List or This GitHub Organization or Our Discord Server orâ€¦

We are assembling a mailing list to keep those interested in the loop, without needing to sign up for a Discord or GitHub or some other account. We will not spam you, we will not sell your contact information, you may opt out at any time.

If you would like to be added to the mailing list, or this GitHub organization (InnovateForVegas) please send an email to

[AddMe+Listserv @ InnovateForVegas.org](mailto:addme+listserv@innovateforvegas.org)

[AddMe+GitHub @ InnovateForVegas.org](mailto:addme+github@innovateforvegas.org)

We have a Discord Server for discussion and engagement with our Communities at large (those who would like to participate through discussion or perhaps just lurking), feel free to join the discussion (our actual project efforts should still take place closer to the work, mostly on GitHub).
