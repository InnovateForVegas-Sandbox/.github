# The Innovate for Vegas Foundation Sandbox .github repository

Community Health files and our GitHub profile content for the Sandbox orgâ€¦

## What

This GitHub organization is a sibling of sorts, enabling members to learn how to use GitHub, try out ideas, etc.

While the same policies and default licensing applies to everything in the Sandbox, the intent is most definitely **NOT** to deploy or otherwise release anything from this sandbox. Rather, should a repository developed in the Sandbox be deemed release-worthy (or perhaps on track to be), it can be moved to the main *InnovateForVegas* org. This is highly unlikely, but it is possible.
